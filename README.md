## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Uses Google SpeechRecognition to capture user queries.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses Google Gemini AI API to generate intelligent answers.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Implements Pyttsx3 to convert AI-generated responses into speech.
- **Audio Feedback**: Pygame is used to enhance the user interaction with sound effects.
- **Seamless Voice Interaction**: Supports hands-free voice commands and responses.
